Only native spanish speakers should say the phrase: "Certifico que soy una persona humana real y que no estoy actualmente en este registro". If other words or extra validation phrases are required, they must be said in Spanish as well. Casual omission of words of the phrase, or accents are not grounds for removals or challenges and rejections. Mispronunciations of the words in that phrase are. Submitters should speak in their normal voice and should not attempt mimicking someone elseâ€™s voice. Speaking before or after the required sentence is acceptable.
